# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

# Linda, the human resources manager, shared that their hiring decision is based on the candidate's assessment score and also their location, since it's an office-based position. Let's create variables to hold these values. For now, we'll store fake data but then the HR department will include real data from candidates.
# The company is looking to grow the US team, so eligible candidates have to be based in the US. Additionally, candidates must have an assessment score that is at least 75. Let's check if our mock candidate fulfills the requirements.
# Okay, we printed a message for candidates we want to hire. Now, let's print a message for candidates that are not a good fit.
# Linda from HR just called and informed us that we will be opening an office in Canada. Candidates from Canada are now eligible for hiring as well. Let's add this new condition to our program.
# We don't want to miss out on hiring promising candidates just because of their locations! Let's add another check to offer an alternative to candidates that did well for the assessment but are based outside the US and Canada.

  print(f"Thank you for your interest, we regret to inform you that we will not be moving forward with your application.")
