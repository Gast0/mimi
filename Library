# TUPLES, DICTIONARIES AND SETS

# Let’s use our knowledge of Tuples, Dictionaries and Sets to assemble an inventory for a personal library.
# We’ll create a Dictionary to store books, Tuples to store a books info and Sets to store every author the library has.
# First, we need to store some book’s info.
# Now let’s create the dictionary to store the books previously created and display it.
# Let’s add a book to the dictionary.
"""
Imagine we want to check if an author is in our library.
To do that, we should check every book and ask if the author of that book is the same we are looking for. This operation could be time consuming so we want to use another structure that can help us with this operation.
Let's analyze this scenario and decide on the best structure:
    Authors won't need any other information besides their name.
    We don't want to save multiple times the same author if we have two different books with the same author.
    We want to save time searching if the author is in our library.
This scenario is perfect for a Set!
So let's create a Set to save this authors.
"""
# Now that we have our authors Set created we have to populate it. To do that we have to check every book of our library my_books and add it's author to my_authors_set.
# For now let’s loop through our books and obtain all the information about every book.
# Now that we have the information about a book, let’s obtain only the author. But first let's delete the previous print statement. It was only necessary for last lesson.
# Lastly let’s add the books and display the set containing our authors. But first let's delete the previous print statement. It was only necessary for last lesson.
# Now that we have my_books_authors populated, let’s check if Ray Bradbury belongs to the Set.
# Let’s display a message if Ray Bradbury belongs to our authors.
