# TUPLES, DICTIONARIES AND SETS

# Let’s use our knowledge of Tuples, Dictionaries and Sets to assemble an inventory for a personal library.
# We’ll create a Dictionary to store books, Tuples to store a books info and Sets to store every author the library has.
# First, we need to store some book’s info.
